The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors, and matches the second element
only if it immediately follows the first element and both are children of the same parent element.
In the example, <section> is the parent element. <h2> and <p> elements are children of the same parent element.
<h2> immediately precedes the first <p> element, but not the second, so only the first <p> element will be affected.
